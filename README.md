# Bookshelf Project

The basis of this project is a book shelf application intended to be used by everybody.

The stack consists of React, making use of `useState` and `useEffect` to handle reactivitiy.

There are two views, the book shelf which lists all the users current collection. As well as a search page where users can add new books to their list.

The api was provided by Udacity and deals with common CRUD operations.
